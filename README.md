# Set up

1. Install ffmpeg.
2. (Optional) install git for quicker access to the scripts.

# Instructions

1. Create a folder somewhere on your computer. Remember that you name it. It should be something that is easy to remember, like "hap_input".
2. Change the value of the `input_dir` variable to the name of the folder that you created.
3. Place the .mov files in the input directory that you want HAP encoded.
4. Run the script in your terminal with `./hap-encoder.sh`.
5. The script will create an output folder, which you can also specify by changing the value of the `output_dir` variable.
6. Verify that the output finished correctly by looking at the contents of the output folder.
